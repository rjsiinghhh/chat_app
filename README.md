# chat_app


Check out the other chat app. chat_2. That is the one that works. Both were done the same way, but ran into some server issues with this one. So go check it out!!!! The working site is beautiful, so beautiful that you can throw your phone in the river, go home, fire up your internet and leave me a message telling me how amazing it is over there! I'm just kidding ... there are soooooo many ways of losing your phone to use CHAT_2! So go do it! let me know how much you regret it after! Talk to you soon!!!!
